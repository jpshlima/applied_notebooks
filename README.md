The scripts are divided in classification and regression tasks, for Scenarios 1 and 2.
In addition, the classification task employs Python and Octave algorithms, whereas regression uses only Python.
It is advised to start with 'python_classification_scenario01.ipynb'.

The other files are data collected from simulation campaigns in ns-3.
