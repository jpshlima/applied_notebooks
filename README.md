The scripts are divided in classification and regression tasks, for Scenarios 1 and 2.
In addition, the classification task employs Python and Matlab algorithms, whereas regression uses only Python.
It is advised to start with 'python_classification_scenario01.ipynb'.

The Matlab files are all kept in a specific folder. Inside, you can find .mat variables used to feed our
algorithms. These .mat files contain exactly the same data used in Python scripts.

The other files in root repository are the data collected from simulation campaigns in ns-3.

The database and the code are available to be reproduced. Please cite our work.
